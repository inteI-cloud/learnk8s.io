Authenticating microservices requests in Kubernetes

If your infrastructure consists of several applications interacting with each other, you might have faced the 
issue of securing the communication between services to prevent unauthenticated requests. Imagine having three apps:

1. An API
2. A data store
3. A secret store

You might want the secret store only to reply to requests to the API and reject any request from the data store.

How would the secret store decide to authenticate or deny the request?

A popular approach is to request and pass identity tokens to every call within services. So instead of 
issuing a request from the API service or the data store to the secret store directly, you might need 
to go through an Authorisation service first, authenticate and retrieve a token that is passed along 
to your request. That way, when the data store gets a token and presents it to the secret store, 
it is rejected, but if the API service presents one, it will be accepted.

![Three apps](./image1.png)

You have several options when it comes to Authorisation server:

- You could use static tokens that don‚Äôt expire (and perhaps hardcoding them in the applications that 
  communicate with each other and removing the need for an authorisation server at all)
- You could use oAuth by setting up an internal oAuth server
- You could roll out your own authorisation mechanism such as mutual TLS certificates

All authorisation servers have to do is to:

1. Authenticate the caller -  The caller should have an identity that it‚Äôs part of the network and  verifiable
2. Generate a token with a limited scope, validity and the desired audience
3. Validate a token - The called service would call the Authorisation server with the provided token and accept the request if the validation is successful and reject it otherwise

Examples of Authorisation servers are tools such as [Keycloak]() or [Dex]().

You might have not noticed, but Kubernetes offers the same primitives of the authorisation service within the 
cluster with Service Account, Roles and RoleBindings.

You assign identities using Service Accounts. Service accounts are linked to roles to define what
resources they have access to. 

Tokens are generated as soon as you create the Service Account and stored in a Secret

You use the secret as a mechanism to authenticate to the API and make requests. You only receive 
successful replies for the resources you are entitled to consume

Could you use Service Accounts as a mechanism to authenticate requests between apps in the cluster?

_What if the Kubernetes API could be used as an Authorisation server?_

You could leverage the Service Account as tokens and validate their authenticity with the built-in Kubernetes API.

Let‚Äôs try that.

You will now deploy two services:

1. We will refer to these services as the API service (API) and the Secret store 
2. They are written in the Go programming language and they communicate via HTTP 
3. Each service will run in its own namespaces and use dedicated service accounts
4. The secret store requires that any client communicating to it identifies itself 
   via a valid service account token passed as a HTTP header

## Setting up

You will need access to a Kubernetes cluster with the ServiceAccountVolume projection feature enabled. 
You will learn more about this feature later on in the article. The ServiceAccountVolume projection 
requires the Kubernetes API server to be started with certain specific API flags. The support for 
different Kubernetes providers may vary.

However, you can instead use the latest version of [minikube](). From your terminal, run:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.service-account-signing-key-file=/var/lib/minikube/certs/sa.key --extra-config=apiserver.service-account-issuer=kubernetes/serviceaccount --extra-config=apiserver.service-account-api-audiences=api
```


You should also clone the repository https://github.com/amitsaha/kubernetes-sa-volume-demo as 
it contains the demo source code that will be referred to in the article.

## Inter-Service authentication using Service accounts

The API service is a headless web application listening on port 8080. When a client makes any request to 
it, the following steps occur in the backend:

1. It reads the service account token
2. Makes a HTTP GET request to the secret store service passing the X-Client-Id header with the token
3. Returns the response it receives from the secret store

The secret store service is another headless web application listening on port 8081. When a 
client makes any request to it, the following happens:

1. It looks for the X-Client-Id HTTP header in the request. If one is not found, a HTTP 401 error is sent back as a response.
2. If the header is found, the value for the header is then checked with the Kubernetes API for its validity
3. If the header value is found to be valid, the request is accepted, else rejected with a HTTP 403 error response

Next, you will deploy the services to the cluster.

### Deploy the API service

Go to the `service_accounts/api` directory of the cloned repository.  This contains the source code for the 
application along with the Dockerfile. A built image (amitsaha/k8s-sa-volume-demo-api:sa-1 ) has been pushed
to docker hub, so you will not need to build it locally and we refer to that image from the Kubernetes 
deployment manifest.

To deploy the image, you will create the following resources:

- **Namespace** - api
- **ServiceAccount** - api in the **Namespace** api
- **Deployment** - app in the **Namespace** api

The YAML manifest can be found in the `deployment.yaml` file. Run `kubectl apply` to create the above resources:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

You should see the following resources created:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
namespace/api created
serviceaccount/api created
deployment.apps/app created
```


To be able to access this service from the host system, you will have to expose the service first:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
kubectl -n api expose deployment app --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
service/app exposed
```

Then, run:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
minikube service app -n api
```

The above command will end an output like this:

üéâ  Opening service api/app in default browser...
‚ùó  Because you are using a Docker driver on darwin, the terminal needs to be open to run it.

You will also see a browser window opened automatically with a URL pointing to the deployed service. 
The web page will have this message:


Get "http://app.secret-store.svc.cluster.local": dial tcp: lookup app.secret-store.svc.cluster.local: no such host


This is expected since we haven‚Äôt yet deployed the secret store service.

_Keep the browser tab and above terminal window open_

Open a new terminal to carry out the next set of steps.


### Deploy the Secret Store service

Go to the `service_accounts/secret-store` directory. This contains the source code for the application 
along with the Dockerfile. A built image (amitsaha/k8s-sa-volume-demo-ss:sa-1) has been pushed to docker hub, 
so you will not need to build it locally and we refer to that image from the Kubernetes deployment manifest.

To deploy the image, you will create the following resources:

- **Namespace** - secret-store
- **ServiceAccount** - secret-store in the **Namespace** secret-store
- **ClusterRoleBinding** - role-tokenreview-binding to bind secret-store **ServiceAccount** to 
  system:auth-delegator role
- **Deployment** - app in **Namespace**  secret-store
- **Service** - secret-store in **Namespace** secret-store


A manifest creating the above resources can be found in the `deployment.yaml` file. 

Run kubectl apply to create the above resources:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Now, go back to the browser tab which had the API service URL opened and **reload** the tab. 

You will see the message: _‚ÄúHello from secret store. You have been authenticated‚Äù_

This tells us that the secret store service could successfully verify the token that API service provided in its request. 

_But how does all of that work? Let‚Äôs find out._

Keep the two terminal sessions running and switch to a new terminal session.


## Under the hood

Service accounts are a way to associate your Kubernetes workload with an identity. You can use 
Service Accounts  to define what resources should be accessible in the cluster and who can access them.
For example, when you want to restrict reading Secrets only to admin users in the cluster, you can do so 
using a service account. Service Accounts aren‚Äôt just for users, though. You can authenticate humans as 
well as applications in the cluster. If you want your applications to list all the available Pods in 
the cluster, you will need to create a Service Account that is associated with read-only access to the 
Pod API. 

Service accounts are useful and straightforward, but you should know that:

1. When you create a Service Account, Kubernetes creates a companion Secret object with a token. 
   Then, you use the token to authenticate with the Kubernetes API. Since there‚Äôs a one-to-one 
   relationship between the two, any workload that can read a secret in a namespace can also read 
   the service account tokens in the same namespace In other words, you could have any 
   workload using another Service Account in the same namespace to authenticate against the 
   Kubernetes API ‚Äî effectively impersonating someone else. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no mechanism to 
   restrict access to a subset of Secrets in a namespace. The application has access to all of them,
   or none of them.
 2. The tokens associated with a Service Account are long-lived and do not expire. In other words, once 
    you have access to one of them, you can use it forever (or until the administrator deletes the secret
    associated with the token).
 3. No audience binding of the tokens. As a cluster administrator, you cannot associate a token with a 
    specific intended audience for different workloads. This means that anyone with access to the 
    service account token can authenticate itself and are authorized to communicate with any other 
    service running inside the cluster. The destination service doesn‚Äôt have any way to verify whether 
    the token it was presented with was meant for itself at all.

Tokens associated with Service Accounts are verified by the Kubernetes API. In particular, there‚Äôs a 
specific component in charge of validating and rejecting them: the **Token Review API**.

Let‚Äôs manually create a token and validate it against the Token Review API.

### Creating a Service Account

Consider the following YAML manifest to create a namespace, `test` and a service account, `sa-test-1` in it:

```yaml|title=sa.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: test
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: sa-test-1
  namespace: test
```

Save the above into a file `sa.yaml` and run kubectl apply:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
kubectl apply -f sa.yaml

namespace/test created
serviceaccount/sa-test-1 created
```

To view the token associated with the service account:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
kubectl --namespace test describe sa sa-test-1
Name:            	sa-test-1
Namespace:       	test
Labels:          	<none>
Annotations:     	kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration:
                   	{"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"ServiceAccount","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"sa-test-1","namespace":"test"}}
Image pull secrets:  <none>
Mountable secrets:   sa-test-1-token-99l5r
Tokens:          	sa-test-1-token-99l5r
Events:          	<none>
```

Then to view the secret object:

```
kubectl --namespace test describe secret sa-test-1-token-99l5r
Name:     	sa-test-1-token-99l5r
Namespace:	test
Labels:   	<none>
Annotations:  kubernetes.io/service-account.name: sa-test-1
          	kubernetes.io/service-account.uid: d2d210d8-8bd6-4115-b796-5ff4bd373d74

Type:  kubernetes.io/service-account-token

```

The `token` object in the Data is a base64 encoded object representing a JSON web token payload. Once you have an 
appropriate RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding setup, you can then provide this token to perform operations in 
the cluster from within a pod. For example, given a service account token, you want to verify whether the 
token is valid or not by invoking the Kubernetes TokenReview API. 

### Verifying a token using TokenReview API

A Service Account is just an identity with no permissions associated with it.

If you want to grant access to the Service account you need two more objects: a binding and a role.

In the role you define access to the resources such as read-only access to Secrets or only GET, DESCRIBE and LIST operations on Pods.

Kubernetes comes with a list of roles prepackaged that you can list with:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
kubectl get roles
```

In the following example, you will use the `system:auth-delegator` role which has all the 
permission you need to call the Token Review API. You can inspect it with:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
kubectl get role system:auth-delegator
```

The only part missing is the binding.

You can create a ClusterRoleBinding to link the Service Account to a role and grant the permission cluster wide:

```yaml|title=sa_rbac.yaml
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: role-tokenreview-binding
  namespace: test
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: system:auth-delegator
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: sa-test-1
  namespace: test
```

Save the above into a new file, sa_rbac.yaml and run kubectl apply:

```
kubectl apply -f sa_rbac.yaml
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/role-tokenreview-binding created
```

You have now created a service account and associated it with a ClusterRole to allow it to invoke the 
TokenReview API. How should you use it? Here‚Äôs one way:

1. You could assign the Service Account to a Pod
2. Invoke a HTTP client in that Pod to query the TokenReview API (You should be able to query the API 
   because you assigned the `system:auth-delegator` role). When  making the request, you will pass on 
   the service account token associated with the pod as a header value to the TokenReview API
3. You will verify the same token that you are using to authenticate. It‚Äôs an artificial scenario but 
   it solves our purpose here.

The image you will use to create the pod needs to have the bash, curl and the sleep programs available. 
You can use the image amitsaha/curl - which I created for this article and is available on docker hub.

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
kubectl run --namespace=test --serviceaccount=sa-test-1 --generator=run-pod/v1 \
  curl --image=amitsaha/curl  --image-pull-policy=Never --restart='Never' --command -- sleep 3600
pod/curl created
```

Now, run kubectl describe to show details about the pod that was just created:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
kubectl --namespace test describe pod curl
Name:     	curl
Namespace:	test
..
Containers:
  curl:
	Container ID:  docker://9dc09c2f6f78b54e600eaec10db0885bad3da455126ab9230ac1914a301f445e
	Image:     	amitsaha/curl
	Image ID:  	docker://sha256:db3743f4dce44c902e0b89382d96d78ccf6adee92116cbfdb0c713591d0b08a8
	Port:      	<none>
	Host Port: 	<none>
	Command:
  	sleep
  	3600
	State:      	Running
  	Started:  	Fri, 18 Sep 2020 17:06:22 +1000
	Ready:      	True
	Restart Count:  0
	Environment:	<none>
	Mounts:
  	/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from sa-test-1-token-smgh4 (ro)
..

```

The key information in the above output is that the service account token is available to the pod 
in the directory, `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount`. When a Pod is created, the Service 
Account data is automatically mounted as a volume and the Service Account token is available as a 
file inside that directory. 

Let‚Äôs retrieve the token.

Use kubectl exec to start a shell session inside the running pod:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
kubectl --namepsace test exec -ti curl bash        	 
root@curl:/#   
```

Inside the shell session, first export a few variables.

First up, let‚Äôs export the APISERVER variable pointing to the Kubernetes API:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
# APISERVER=https://kubernetes.default.svc
```

The SERVICEACCOUNT variable points to the filesystem directory at which the service account related files can be found:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
# SERVICEACCOUNT=/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
```

The NAMESPACE variable contains the namespace obtained via reading the contents of the namespace file in the above directory:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
# NAMESPACE=$(cat ${SERVICEACCOUNT}/namespace)
```

The TOKEN variable contains the service account token obtained via reading the contents of the token file in the same directory:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
# TOKEN=$(cat ${SERVICEACCOUNT}/token)
```

The CACERT variable points to the Certificate Authority bundle that curl will use to verify the Kubernetes API certificate:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
# CACERT=${SERVICEACCOUNT}/ca.crt
```

Let‚Äôs issue a request to theAPI and see if you can authenticate

```terminal|command=1|title=bash
# curl --cacert ${CACERT} --header "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" -X GET ${APISERVER}/api
{
  "kind": "APIVersions",
  "versions": [
	"v1"
  ],
  "serverAddressByClientCIDRs": [
	{
  	"clientCIDR": "0.0.0.0/0",
  	"serverAddress": "172.17.0.3:8443"
	}
  ]
}
```

Excellent, you can reach the Kubernetes API.

Note how you passed the Authorization header containing the service account token. If you don‚Äôt 
supply it or pass in an invalid token, you will get a HTTP 403 error response as follows:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash

# curl --cacert ${CACERT} -X GET ${APISERVER}/api
{
  "kind": "Status",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    
  },
  "status": "Failure",
  "message": "forbidden: User \"system:anonymous\" cannot get path \"/api\"",
  "reason": "Forbidden",
  "details": {
    
  },
  "code": 403
}
```

Next, you will see how you can invoke the `TokenReview API` to verify a service account token. 

### Sending a token verification request

To issue a request to the TokenReviewAPI, you need two parts:

1. The API endpoint that you should call which is `/apis/authentication.k8s.io/v1/tokenreviews`.
2. A payload with the information about the token that you wish to validate.

The API endpoint expects a POST request with a JSON formatted payload of the following form:

```json
{
  "kind": "TokenReview",
  "apiVersion": "authentication.k8s.io/v1",
  "spec": {
	"token": "<your token>"
  }
}
```

In this case, the token you will use to authenticate to the API server as well as verify the status 
of is the same. Thus, the curl command to run in the pod shell session is:

```terminal|command=1|title=bash

# curl --cacert ${CACERT} -X "POST" $APISERVER/apis/authentication.k8s.io/v1/tokenreviews -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"  -H "Content-Type: application/json; char
set=utf-8" -d '{"kind": "TokenReview","apiVersion": "authentication.k8s.io/v1", "spec": {"token": "'$TOKEN'"}}'
```

The response will look as follows:

```json

{
  "kind": "TokenReview",
  "apiVersion": "authentication.k8s.io/v1",
  "metadata": {
	"creationTimestamp": null,
	"managedFields": [

	]
  },
  "spec": {

  },
  "status": {
	"authenticated": true,
	"user": {
  	"username": "system:serviceaccount:test:sa-test-1",
  	"uid": "42d43e46-76fe-441f-8281-a566964e52fe",
  	"groups": [
    	"system:serviceaccounts",
    	"system:serviceaccounts:test",
    	"system:authenticated"
  	]
	},
	"audiences": [
  	"api"
	]
  }
}
```

The key information in the response is in the status object with the following fields:

- **authenticated**: This is set to true which means the token was successfully validated by the API server
- The user field is another object with the following fields:
username: The value of this key represents the username corresponding to the service account used by the pod - system:serviceaccount:test:sa-test-1
uid: The value of this key represents the system user ID for the user
Groups: The value of this key is a list containing the groups the user belongs to
audiences: The value of this field is a list of audiences the token is intended for. This field allows the token receiver to verify whether it is in the list of allowed audiences and hence can decide to accept it or reject it. In this case, the default audience is returned which was configured when you started the minikube cluster using --extra-config=apiserver.service-account-api-audiences=api.


Excellent, you just verified the token!

You know that:

The token is valid.
The identity of the caller (the Service Account).
The groups that the caller belongs to.

You could leverage the information in your Secret Store component to validate the request!

Let‚Äôs have a look at how you could include the above logic in your apps by looking at how the API and the secret store services are implemented.
Implementation of the services

Here‚Äôs how the two services interact with each other and the Kubernetes API:

At startup, an API service pod reads the service account token from the filesystem inside the pod and keeps it in memory
The API pod then calls the secret store service passing the token as a HTTP header, X-Client-Id
At startup, the secret service pod uses the Kubernetes Go client reads its own service account token from the filesystem and keeps it in memory
When a secret store pod receives a request from an API pod, it reads the value of the X-Client-Id header and makes a validation request to to the TokenReview API using the token read in step 3 to authenticate and authorize itself to the Kubernetes API
If the API response comes back as authenticated, the secret store service responds with a successful message, else reports back a 401

The following diagram represents the above call flow:




First let‚Äôs look at the implementation of the API service. You can find the application code in the file service_accounts/api/main.go. 

To read the service account token, the following function is used:

func readToken() {
	b, err := ioutil.ReadFile("/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	serviceToken = string(b)	
}

Then, the service token is passed on to the call to the Secret store service in a HTTP header, X-Client-Id:

func handleIndex(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

	...
	client := &http.Client{}
	req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", serviceConnstring, nil)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	req.Header.Add("X-Client-Id", serviceToken)
	resp, err := client.Do(req)
	..




The following YAML manifest is used to deploy the API service:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: api
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: api
  namespace: api

          value: "http://app.secret-store.svc.cluster.local"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080

You will notice that there is nothing special about the deployment manifest above other than specifying a service account to the deployment. 

Let‚Äôs move onto the secret store service. You can find the complete application in service_accounts/secret-store/main.go.

The secret store service does two key things:

It retrieves the value of the X-Client-Id header from the incoming request
It then invokes the Kubernetes TokenReview API with the value retrieved to check if it is a valid token or not

Step (1) is performed by the following code:

clientId := r.Header.Get("X-Client-Id")
	if len(clientId) == 0 {
		http.Error(w, "X-Client-Id not supplied", http.StatusUnauthorized)
		return
	}


Then, step (2) is performed using the Kubernetes Go client. First, we create a ClientSet object:


config, err := rest.InClusterConfig()
..

clientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config)

The `InClusterConfig()` function automatically reads the service account token for the pod and hence you do not have to manually specify the filesystem path.

Then, you construct a TokenReview object specifying the Token you want to validate in the Token field:

tr := authv1.TokenReview{
	Spec: authv1.TokenReviewSpec{
	    Token: clientId,
	},
}

Then, create a TokenReview request:	

result, err := clientset.AuthenticationV1().TokenReviews().Create(ctx, &tr, metav1.CreateOptions{})

The following YAML manifest will create the various resources needed for the secret store service:


apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: secret-store
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount

        image: amitsaha/k8s-sa-volume-demo-ss:sa-1
        env:
        - name: LISTEN_ADDR
          value: ":8081"
        ports:

spec:
  selector:
    app: secret-store
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8081


Compared to the API service, the secret store service requires a ClusterRoleBinding resource to be created which associates the secret-store service account to the system:auth-delegator ClusterRole.


Go back to the terminal session where you deployed the secret store service from and run `kubectl --namepsace secret-store logs <pod id>` and you will see the following log lines where you can see the response from the TokenReview API call:

2020/08/21 09:09:10 v1.TokenReviewStatus{Authenticated:true, User:v1.UserInfo{Username:"system:serviceaccount:secret-store:secret-store", UID:"24ae6734-9ca1-44d8-af93-98b6e6f8da17", Groups:[]string{"system:serviceaccounts", "system:serviceaccounts:api", "system:authenticated"}, Extra:map[string]v1.ExtraValue(nil)}, Audiences:[]string{"api"}, Error:""}

This is a Go structure version of the JSON response you saw earlier. 

Thus, you see how API service reads the service account token and passes it onto its request to the secret store service as a way to authenticate itself. The secret store service retrieves the token and then checks with the Kubernetes API whether it is valid or not. If valid, the secret store service allows the request from the API service to be processed. This suffers from two drawbacks:

Anyone - human or otherwise with the permission to read the secret token in the api namespace can send a request to the secret store successfully. There is no embedded information in the token that the secret store can use to validate its intended audience.

The secret token doesn‚Äôt expire at all. If it is stolen, the only way to revoke it is to delete the service account and recreate it. 

You can solve the above problems by implementing solutions such as mutual TLS or using a JWT based solution with a central authority server.  

However, in Kubernetes, you can use the service account token volume projection feature to create time-bound and audience-specific service account tokens which do not persist in the cluster store. The Kubernetes API server performs the role of the central authority server and you don‚Äôt have to worry about any of the internal details of expiring the tokens and more.  This feature was introduced in Kubernetes 1.12 and gained further improvements in 1.13 and provides a more secure alternative to workload-specific service accounts. In fact, this will be promoted to a GA feature in Kubernetes 1.20.

Before we move on, cleanup the two namespaces for the services which will also delete the other resources we created:

$ kubectl delete ns api
$ kubectl delete ns secret-store

Inter-Service authentication using service account token volume projection
Now, you will learn to use Service Account Token Volume Projection (`ProjectedServiceAccountToken`) for workload identity in Kubernetes. The service account tokens made available to workloads via this mechanism are time-limited, audience bound and are not associated with secret objects. If a pod is deleted or the service account is removed, these tokens become invalid, thus preventing any abuse if stolen.

A `serviceAccountToken` volume projection is one of the `projected` volume types. When this volume type is added to a pod, the service account token is injected at a configured filesystem path inside. This is similar to how the service account tokens are mounted inside the pod. There‚Äôs a difference though., the kubelet automatically rotates the token when it‚Äôs about to expire. In addition, you can configure the path at which you want this token to be available.
API

You will now modify the code for the API service to read the service account token mounted via volume projection and use that to authenticate to the secret store service:

b, err := ioutil.ReadFile("/var/run/secrets/tokens/api-token")
serviceToken = string(b)

Note the path to the service account token is different from the previous case. You will see how this is configured in the deployment manifest.

Since the service account token volume projection feature relies on the token being refreshed periodically by the kubelet, it is recommended to re-read the token every 5 minutes in the application code. You can accomplish this via a ticker in Golang as follows:

ticker := time.NewTicker(300 * time.Second)
done := make(chan bool)
 
go func() {
    for {
        select {
   	case <-done:
   	    return
   	case <-ticker.C:
   	    readToken()
   	}
   }
 }()

The readToken() function reads the file, /var/run/secrets/tokens/api-token and sets the global variable, serviceToken to the token value. hyuiIf you are not familiar with Go‚Äôs ticker, think of a ticker as a background thread which runs a function at periodic intervals.

You can find the entire application code in service_accounts_volume_projection/api/main.go
Now, let‚Äôs deploy this service.  A built image (amitsaha/k8s-sa-volume-demo-api:sa-2 ) has been pushed to docker hub, so you will not need to build it locally. 

You will use that image in the deployment manifest (service_accounts_volume_projection/api/deployment.yaml):


apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: api
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: api
  namespace: api
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app
  namespace: api
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: api
    spec:
      serviceAccount: api
      volumes:
        - name: api-token
          projected:
            sources:
            - serviceAccountToken:
                path: api-token
                expirationSeconds: 600
                audience: secret-store
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: amitsaha/k8s-sa-volume-demo-api:sa-2
        env:
        - name: LISTEN_ADDR
          value: ":8080"
        - name: SECRET_STORE_CONNSTRING
          value: "http://app.secret-store.svc.cluster.local"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/tokens
            name: api-token


The projected volume specification above is defined as:

volumes:
        - name: api-token
          projected:
            sources:
            - serviceAccountToken:
                path: api-token
                expirationSeconds: 600
                audience: secret-store

A volume named `api-token` of `projected` type will be created with the source being `serviceAccountToken`. 

The `path` indicates the file where the token will be available inside the configured volume, audience field specifies what the intended audience for the token is (if not specified, it defaults to `api`) and the expirationSeconds indicate how long a token is valid for - the minimum is 600 seconds or 10 minutes. 

The audience field in the manifest says that this service account token is allowed to communicate with another service which identifies itself with the `secret-store` audience. Going back to the example scenario introduced at the beginning, by deploying the data store service without adding secret-store to the list of valid audiences, it will not be able to communicate with the secret store.

Note that if you are deploying a pod to use this feature in a cluster with pod security policies enforced, you will need to ensure that the `projected` volume type is allowed.

Go  into `service_accounts_volume_projection/api/` directory and run kubectl apply:

$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

To be able to access this service from the host system, you will first need to expose the service as earlier:

$ kubectl -n api expose deployment app --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080 
service/app exposed

Then, run:

$ minikube service app -n api

..
üéâ  Opening service api/app in default browser...
‚ùó  Because you are using a Docker driver on darwin, the terminal needs to be open to run it.


As earlier, a browser tab will open and you should see the following:

Get "http://app.secret-store.svc.cluster.local": dial tcp: lookup app.secret-store.svc.cluster.local: no such host



This is expected as the secret store is not yet deployed. 

Keep the tab and the terminal window open. 

Next, let‚Äôs modify and deploy the secret store service.

Secret Store
The token review payload for the secret store will now be as follows:

tr := authv1.TokenReview{
   	 Spec: authv1.TokenReviewSpec{
   		 Token: 	clientId,
   		 Audiences: []string{"secret-store"},
   	 },
    }

Now, in the TokenReview object, secret store explicitly passes ‚Äúsecret-store‚Äù as the audience for the token it is asking the API to review. If the token doesn‚Äôt include ‚Äúsecret-store‚Äù as an audience, the Token Review API will not authenticate the request. In other words, the secret store service can assert the identity of the caller and validate that the incoming request token was meant for the secret store service.

You can find the entire application code in service_accounts_volume_projection/secret-store/main.go

Now, let‚Äôs deploy this service. 

A built image (amitsaha/k8s-sa-volume-demo-ss:sa-2 ) has been pushed to docker hub, so you will not need to build it locally. You will use that image in the deployment manifest (service_accounts_volume_projection/ss/deployment.yaml).

The deployment manifest for the secret store will be the same as earlier. Go  into `service_accounts/secret-store/` file and run kubectl apply:

$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
namespace/secret-store created
serviceaccount/secret-store created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/role-tokenreview-binding configured
deployment.apps/app created
service/app created

Let‚Äôs check if the service is up and running correctly:

$ kubectl -n secret-store describe svc app
Name:          	app
Namespace:     	secret-store
Labels:        	<none>
Annotations:   	kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration:
                 	{"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"Service","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"app","namespace":"secret-store"},"spec":{"ports":[{"port":80,"pro...
Selector:      	app=secret-store
Type:          	ClusterIP
IP:            	10.106.239.243
Port:          	<unset>  80/TCP
TargetPort:    	8081/TCP
Endpoints:     	172.18.0.5:8081
Session Affinity:  None
Events:        	<none>


The Endpoints output tells us that service is now up and running.

Go back to the browser tab with the API service terminal open and reload the page. You will now see:

Hello from secret-store. You have been authenticated



If you now view the logs of secret store via kubectl -n secret-store logs <pod id>, you will see the following:

(v1.TokenReviewStatus) &TokenReviewStatus{Authenticated:true,User:UserInfo{Username:system:serviceaccount:api:api,UID:ec7c304f-9722-4d1b-9f67-d3ce32cd8d4c,Groups:[system:serviceaccounts system:serviceaccounts:api system:authenticated],Extra:map[string]ExtraValue{authentication.kubernetes.io/pod-name: [app-65d954658c-dbbr5],authentication.kubernetes.io/pod-uid: [1b37a3f4-54f1-419c-b435-affce3f4a0f3],},},Error:,Audiences:[secret-store],}


In the logs of the API service, you can see log lines as follows which shows the service account token being re-read from the filesystem:

2020/08/26 05:03:43 Refreshing service account token
2020/08/26 05:13:42 Refreshing service account token
2020/08/26 05:18:42 Refreshing service account token

Summary

Service Account Token Volume projection allows you to associate non-global, time-bound and audience bound service tokens to your Kubernetes workloads. In this article you saw an example of using it for authentication between your services and how it is a better alternative to using the default service account tokens. 

Kubernetes native software such as linkerd and istio are embracing it for their internal communication and managed Kubernetes service providers such as GKE and AWS EKS are using this projection volume type to enable more robust pod identity systems.
